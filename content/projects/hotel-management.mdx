## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgc1210/hotel-management.git
cd hotel-management
npm install
```

### 2.Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core)

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Restore the .NET packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Configure your database connection by updating appsettings.json:

```bash
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=HotelManagementDB;Uid=your_username;Pwd=your_password;"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key-here",
    "Issuer": "HotelManagement",
    "Audience": "HotelManagement",
    "ExpiryMinutes": 60
  }
}
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

If migrations don't exist, create them:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

Start the ASP.NET Core development server:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (ReactJS)

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Configure your environment variables by creating a .env file:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:5001/api
REACT_APP_APP_NAME=Hotel Management System
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

### 4. Database Setup

Create the MySQL database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE HotelManagementDB;
```

The Entity Framework migrations will handle the table creation automatically
when you run dotnet ef database update.

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
