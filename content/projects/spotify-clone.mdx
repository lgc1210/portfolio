  users, and statistics.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **MongoDB** (running locally or MongoDB Atlas account)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgc1210/clone-spotify.git
cd clone-spotify
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

Navigate to the backend directory and set up the Django server:

```bash
cd server  # or backend directory
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```bash
# Create .env file with the following variables
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spotify_clone
# Add other necessary environment variables
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser (optional):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django backend will start at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup (ReactJS)

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd client  # or frontend directory
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```bash
# Create .env file with the following variables
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Add other necessary environment variables
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The React development server will start at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. Database Setup

Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:

```bash
# If using local MongoDB
mongod
# Or ensure your MongoDB Atlas connection string is properly configured
```

### 5. Socket Configuration (Optional)

If you're using WebSocket for real-time chat functionality, ensure your Django
backend is configured with Django Channels and Redis (if needed):

```bash
pip install channels redis
```

## API Endpoints

The Django backend provides RESTful API endpoints at
`http://localhost:8000/api/` for:

- User authentication (`/auth/`)
- Songs management (`/songs/`)
- Playlists management (`/playlists/`)
- User management (`/users/`)
- Statistics (`/stats/`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Issues**: Ensure Django CORS headers are properly configured
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB is running and connection string is
   correct
3. **Port Conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000, 5173, and 8000 are available
4. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all required environment variables
   are set

### Environment Variables Checklist

**Backend (.env)**:

- `DEBUG`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

**Frontend (.env)**:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- `VITE_SOCKET_URL`

## Conclusion

This Spotify clone demonstrates a full-stack application built with ReactJS and
Django. By integrating the Django REST API with React, you can create a seamless
music streaming experience with user authentication, playlist management, and
real-time chat functionality. The project showcases modern web development
practices with a responsive UI and efficient backend architecture.
